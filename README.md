# cypher-character-generator-frontend
React frontend for the Cypher System character creator

## Concept
This is a personal project to use Redact and Redux to make a character builder for the Cypher System, a tabletop RPG.
Current state as of 7/9/2020 -> basic character options and stats are in a rough 'layout' and are being rigged up to the store and other logic.
Backend posses some of the required routes for GET requests but there is no current implementation to save a character for later (a to-do item)
